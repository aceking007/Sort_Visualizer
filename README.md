# Sort Visualizer

Have a look at the site [here](https://aceking007.github.io/Sort_Visualizer/index.html).

This repository (and the site above) contains visualizations for various sorting algorithms.  
It can be used as a teaching resource as it provides quite a lot of information along with visual insights on the algorithms.

The source code for the processing sketches are stored in the `processing_source_code` directory.  
It can be run using the [Processing 3 IDE](https://processing.org/download/) or using [Eclipse IDE](https://riptutorial.com/processing/example/31227/using-processing-with-eclipse) with some minor changes.

### Checklist of algorithms:

**Comparison sorts**  
- [x] ~~insertion sort~~
- [x] ~~bubble sort~~
- [x] ~~selection sort~~
- [ ] quick sort
- [ ] merge sort
- [ ] heap sort
- [ ] gnome sort
- [ ] cocktail shaker sort
- [ ] cycle sort
- [ ] shell sort  

**Non-comparison sorts**  
- [ ] radix sort
- [ ] counting sort
- [ ] bucket sort

The visualizations exist for the checked ones, for the others I'm still either understanding/implementing/writing visualization code.
